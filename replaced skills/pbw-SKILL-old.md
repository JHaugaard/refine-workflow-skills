# project-brief-writer

<purpose>
Transform rough project ideas into problem-focused briefs that preserve learning opportunities and feed into the Skills workflow (tech-stack-advisor -> deployment-advisor -> project-spinup).
</purpose>

<output>
- .docs/PROJECT-MODE.md (workflow mode declaration)
- .docs/brief-[project-name].md (polished project brief)
A polished project brief in narrative/bullet format describing problem, goals, requirements, and deployment intent WITHOUT technology stack, architecture, deployment platform specifics, or implementation details. This brief must remain NEUTRAL so downstream skills (tech-stack-advisor, deployment-advisor) can perform their advisory roles without bias.
</output>

<action>Create .docs/PROJECT-MODE.md declaring learning intent before collecting any project information.</action>

<prompt-to-user>
Before we start, I need to understand your learning intent for this project.

**Which mode best fits your project?**

**LEARNING Mode** (Recommended for skill development)
- Want to learn about technology choices and trade-offs
- Willing to explore options and understand alternatives
- Timeline flexible, learning is primary goal

**DELIVERY Mode** (For time-constrained projects)
- Need to ship quickly with minimal learning overhead
- Already know technology stack or constraints
- Timeline tight, speed is critical

**BALANCED Mode** (Flexible approach)
- Want both learning AND reasonable delivery speed
- Willing to explore but pragmatic about time

**Your choice:** [LEARNING / DELIVERY / BALANCED]
</prompt-to-user>

<file-template name=".docs/PROJECT-MODE.md">
# PROJECT-MODE.md
## Workflow Declaration

**Mode:** [USER_CHOICE]
**Decision Date:** [TODAY]

### What This Means

[If LEARNING:]
- Prioritizing understanding technology trade-offs
- Subsequent skills include detailed exploration phases
- Willing to spend time understanding alternatives

[If DELIVERY:]
- Prioritizing speed and efficiency
- Streamlined workflows with quick decisions
- Minimal checkpoints

[If BALANCED:]
- Want both learning and reasonable speed
- Flexible pathways with optional detailed phases

### Workflow Commitments

- Using PROJECT-MODE.md to inform all subsequent decisions
- Following appropriate checkpoint level for this mode
- Mode can be changed by updating this file

### Anti-Bypass Protections

Prevents "Over-Specification Problem" (detailed brief that bypasses learning).
- Each skill checks this file
- Checkpoint strictness based on mode
- Global skipping of ALL checkpoints not allowed in LEARNING/BALANCED modes

<instruction-to-user>
Please fill in this template with your project idea. Focus on WHAT you want to build and WHY, not HOW to build it. Leave sections blank if you haven't thought about them yet - I'll ask follow-up questions.

**Important:** Keep your responses technology-neutral. If you have preferences for specific technologies or platforms, note them in the "User Stated Preferences" section - they'll be forwarded to downstream skills for consideration but won't lock in decisions.

<phase id="3" name="analyze-input">
<action>Analyze user responses for completeness, over-specification, and appropriate detail level.</action>

<checks>
- Completeness: Which sections are empty or vague?
- Over-specification: Are they describing implementation instead of requirements?
- Tech mentions: Did they mention specific technologies in requirements sections?
- Appropriate detail: Too vague (needs expansion) or too detailed (bypasses learning)?
- Deployment intent: Is it clear where this will run?
</checks>

<detection-rules name="over-specification">
<indicators>
- Specific programming languages, frameworks, or libraries in requirements
- Architecture descriptions (microservices, MVC, etc.)
- Implementation patterns or design patterns
- Specific APIs or third-party services (unless core to problem)
- Database schemas or data models
- Deployment platforms or hosting providers (AWS, Vercel, fly.io, Cloudflare, etc.)
- Infrastructure specifics (Docker, Kubernetes, serverless, etc.)
- CI/CD tools or automation platforms

<response-if-overspecified>
I notice you're describing HOW to implement (e.g., 'using Express.js'). For this brief, let's focus on WHAT you need (e.g., 'an API that handles user requests'). The tech-stack-advisor skill will help you explore implementation options later. Would you like to rephrase this as a requirement without specifying the technology?
</response-if-overspecified>

<response-if-tech-in-requirements>
I see you've mentioned [specific technology]. I'll record that as a stated preference in the handoff document. The requirements will stay technology-neutral so downstream skills can provide unbiased recommendations - but your preference will be visible for them to consider. Does that work?
</response-if-tech-in-requirements>

<response-if-deployment-specified>
I see you've mentioned a specific deployment platform/infrastructure [e.g., 'Vercel', 'Docker', 'AWS']. For this brief, I'll capture your deployment intent (localhost vs. public) and record your platform preference separately. The deployment-advisor skill will help evaluate whether that's the best fit for your needs. Does that work?

<guardrails>

<primary-directive>
This skill produces a NEUTRAL handoff document. The brief must NOT influence or constrain decisions made by downstream skills (tech-stack-advisor, deployment-advisor). Any user preferences are recorded separately and clearly labeled as non-binding.
</primary-directive>

<must-do>
- Create .docs/ directory if it doesn't exist
- Keep brief focused on problem space (WHAT, not HOW)
- Redirect over-specification attempts
- Record user preferences in dedicated "User Stated Preferences" section ONLY
- Label all user preferences as "Reference Only" - not requirements
- Preserve learning opportunities (appropriate detail level)
- Generate narrative, scannable output
- Include deployment intent as simple category (Localhost/Public/TBD) without elaboration
- Save to .docs/ subdirectory
- Guide user to next skill in workflow
</must-do>

<must-not-do>
- Specify technologies, frameworks, or libraries in requirements sections
- Include architecture or design patterns in requirements
- Name deployment platforms or hosting providers anywhere except "User Stated Preferences"
- Include infrastructure specifics (Docker, serverless, etc.) in requirements
- Make implementation or deployment decisions
- Endorse or validate user's tech/platform preferences (remain neutral)
- Skip clarifying questions when gaps exist
- Allow hyper-detailed specifications that bypass learning
- Save files outside .docs/ subdirectory
- Include workflow termination guidance that implies deployment choices
</must-not-do>

<neutrality-rules>
When users state technology or platform preferences:
1. Acknowledge the preference without endorsing it
2. Record it verbatim in "User Stated Preferences" section
3. Include the explicit disclaimer that downstream skills will provide unbiased recommendations
4. Do NOT rephrase preferences in a way that makes them sound like requirements
5. Do NOT elaborate on why their preference might be good/bad
</neutrality-rules>

<quality-checks>
Before generating brief, verify:
1. Problem clarity: Clear what problem is being solved and why?
2. Feature completeness: Core features described at appropriate level?
3. Success criteria: Can success be measured?
4. Use cases: Realistic scenarios described?
5. Boundaries: Scope clear (in-scope and out-of-scope)?
6. Tech neutrality: Requirements sections free of ALL implementation details?
7. Deployment neutrality: Deployment intent is category-only (no platform names)?
8. Preference isolation: User preferences appear ONLY in dedicated section with disclaimer?

If any check fails, ask more questions or revise before generating.
</quality-checks>

<examples>

<example name="user-over-specifies">
<user-input>Build a REST API using Node.js and Express with MongoDB database</user-input>
<response>
I notice you're specifying technologies (Node.js, Express, MongoDB). For this brief, let's describe what the API needs to do without specifying the technology.

Try rephrasing as: 'Build an API that stores and retrieves data'

I'll record 'Node.js, Express, MongoDB' in the User Stated Preferences section. The tech-stack-advisor skill will consider these alongside other options for your specific needs. Does that work?
</response>
</example>

<example name="user-too-vague">
<user-input>Build a tool to organize photos</user-input>
<response>
Great starting point! Let me ask some clarifying questions:

**Problem Clarity**
- What specific problem with photo organization are you trying to solve?
- Who will use this tool?
- What's your current workflow, and what's frustrating about it?
- What would 'organized' mean for your photos?
</response>
</example>

<example name="localhost-project">
<user-input>Build a personal task manager that runs on my Mac</user-input>
<response>
I see this is a localhost-only project for personal use. I'll mark the deployment intent as "Localhost."

Let me gather a few more details about your task manager requirements...
</response>
</example>

<example name="user-specifies-platform">
<user-input>I want to build a blog platform and deploy it on Vercel with a Supabase database</user-input>
<response>
I'll capture "Vercel" and "Supabase" as your stated preferences - they'll be recorded in the handoff document for downstream skills to consider.

For the brief itself, I'll describe what the blog platform needs to do (features, requirements) and mark deployment intent as "Public." The deployment-advisor skill will evaluate your Vercel/Supabase preferences alongside other options.

Let me ask some clarifying questions about what the blog should do...
</response>
</example>

<example name="good-user-input">
<user-input>Build a migration tool that transfers images from SmugMug to BackBlaze B2 storage while preserving metadata like dates, titles, and albums.</user-input>
<response>
Excellent! This is a well-scoped problem. Let me ask a few questions:

**Scope & Success**
- Approximately how many images will you be migrating?
- Do you need this to run once, or repeatedly for ongoing sync?
- How will you know the migration was successful?
- What should happen if the migration is interrupted?

**Deployment Intent**
- Will this run only on your computer, or does it need to be accessible remotely?
</response>
</example>

<workflow-position>
Phase 0 in the Skills workflow chain (first skill).
Produces: .docs/PROJECT-MODE.md, .docs/brief-{project}.md for tech-stack-advisor
</workflow-position>

<termination-guidance>
Deployment intent is captured as a simple category only:
- Localhost: Project runs locally
- Public: Project needs online access
- TBD: Decision deferred

Workflow path decisions are made by downstream skills, not this brief.
</termination-guidance>

<status-utility>
Users can invoke the **workflow-status** skill at any time to:
- See current workflow progress
- Check which phases are complete
- Get guidance on next steps
- Review all handoff documents

Mention this option when users seem uncertain about their progress.
