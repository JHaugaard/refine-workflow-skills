# Session Context

## Current Focus

Refining the **Planning Mindset** concept and integrating it into workflow skills.

Two-track approach:
1. **Track 1** (current): Weave Planning Mindset elements throughout workflow skills
2. **Track 2** (future): Extract standalone Planning Mindset skill to skill-foundry

## Key Decisions

### Planning Mindset Refinement (Session 2025-12-06)

**Discovery Protocol** (3 questions max):
1. **Scope**: "What's in scope, what's explicitly out?"
2. **Opportunity**: "What becomes possible for you by building this?" (journey-focused, not pain-points)
3. **Curiosity Prompt**: "What else should I know that I haven't asked?"

**Framing Exercise** (John's blend):
- Solution-Centric (primary): What gets built
- Outcome-Centric (secondary): What it enables
- Exploration-Centric (added): What you'll learn ("eager learner" identity)

**Approval Gates** (minimal friction):
- Two gates: Understanding ("Does this capture it?") + Handoff ("Ready to proceed?")
- Green/Yellow/Red signal language
- Silence never means proceed
- Dynamic "Light" mode - learning pauses decrease with experience

**Sequential Thinking**: Off by default, human-invoked only, rare

## Progress This Session

- Refined all four Planning Mindset elements (Discovery, Framing, Gates, Sequential Thinking)
- Created `.docs/planning-mindset-refinement.md` as tracking document
- **Completed heavy integration into project-brief-writer**:
  - Added `<hard-boundaries>` section at top
  - Replaced Phase 2 with Discovery Protocol
  - Added Phase 3 Framing Exercise with Understanding Gate
  - Updated Phase 5 for JSON handoff (brief.json)
  - Added explicit Handoff Gate to Phase 7
  - Rewrote guardrails with scope-boundaries
  - Updated examples

## Pending

- User reviewing updated project-brief-writer
- User revisiting JSON conversion questions from `docs/workflow-refinement.md`
- Continue with tech-stack-advisor integration (medium weight)
- Continue with deployment-advisor integration (medium weight)
- Review lighter-touch needs for remaining skills
- Eventually extract standalone Planning Mindset skill
